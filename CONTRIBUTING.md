## Reporting issues

We only accept issues that are bug reports or feature requests. Bugs must be isolated and reproducible problems that we can fix within the Ratchet Phonegap Starter App core. Please read the following guidelines before opening any issue.

1. **Search for existing issues.**
2. **Create an isolated and reproducible test case.**
3. **Include a live example if possible.**
4. **Share as much information as possible.** Include at least Rails version and gem version. Also include steps to reproduce the bug.



## Key branches

- Push against master branch until the version is `0.0.0`
- `master` is the latest, deployed version. **Never make pull requests against this branch.**
- `develop` is the official development branch for the next release.
